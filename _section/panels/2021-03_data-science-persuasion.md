# Bridging analytics and policy
This panel brings together data scientists, policy and decision makers to discuss the science and art of data-driven decision and policy making. 
Attendees will hear perspectives from seasoned practitioners about important issues impacting the work of data scientists with policy makers and challenges 
they face in bridging science with policies. Speakers will address their different views on the production and use of evidence, accountabilities that guide 
their formulation and communication of solutions, and the hard and soft skills needed to apply data science for social good.


**Keywords:** Data Science in policy and decision making

<img src="../../images/headshots/Lourdes_Vera.jpg" width="350" height="250"> **Lourdes Vera** is a PhD candidate and member of the Social Science Environmental Health Research Institute (SSEHRI) in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at Northeastern University. Her dissertation research applies a framework of "Environmental Data Justice" developed with the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI) to envision and implement systems of data production and stewardship driven by communities affected by environmental contamination. Specifically, she works with residents in Karnes County, Texas to monitor their air near oil and gas facilities. As a former science teacher, she is interested in fusing critical pedagogy with citizen science to promote democratic participation in science and inform environmental policy. As part of EDGI, Lourdes is on the coordinating committee and facilitates the Environmental Data Justice working group. Lourdes holds an MA in Teaching Earth Science from CUNY Brooklyn College and BA in Urban Studies from Barnard College.
