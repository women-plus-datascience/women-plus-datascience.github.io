Interdisciplinarity is necessary to address issues that are too complex to be dealt with sufficiently through a single discipline. Engaging across disciplines to learn and solve problems is critical to being an effective interdisciplinary scientist. So, how do we do it? Panelists will highlight common issues (process, priorities and perspectives etc.) that researchers must navigate and best practices for forging successful collaborations in a variety of contexts.


**Keywords:** Interdisciplinarity, Data Science collaboration
