# Algorithmic decision-making in child welfare  

Every year there are more than 4 million referrals made to child protection agencies across the US. 
The practice of screening calls is left to each jurisdiction to follow local practices and policies, potentially leading to large variation in the way in which 
referrals are treated across the country. While increasing access to linked administrative data is available, it is difficult for workers to make systematic use of 
historical information about all the children and adults on a single referral call.  Jurisdictions around the country are thus increasingly turning to predictive modeling 
approaches to help distill this rich information.  The end result is typically a single risk score reflecting the likelihood of a near-term adverse event.  
Yet the use of predictive analytics in the area of child welfare remains highly contentious. There is concern that some communities—such as those in poverty or 
from particular racial and ethnic groups—will be disadvantaged by the reliance on government administrative data.  In this talk I will describe some of the work we 
have done both in the lab and in the community as part of developing, deploying and evaluating a prediction tool currently in use in the 
Allegheny County Office of Children, Youth and Families.

Her research investigates questions of algorithmic fairness and accountability in data-driven decision-making systems, with a domain focus on criminal justice and human services.
Her work has been supported through funding from organizations including the Hillman Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, and the NSF Program on Fairness in Artificial Intelligence 
in Collaboration with Amazon. She is a member of the executive committee for the ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency (FAccT), 
and previously served as a Program Committee co-Chair for the conference.

Dr. Chouldechova is a 2020 Research Fellow with the Partnership on AI, where she is working on understanding factors that drive racial bias in 
algorithmic risk assessment tools being developed for use in pre-trial, parole and sentencing contexts. She is also a member of the Pittsburgh Task Force on Public Algorithms.
