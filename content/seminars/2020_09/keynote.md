# Teaching computers to discover scientific knowledge by reading papers  

Enormous amounts of ever-changing knowledge are available online in diverse emergent textual styles (e.g., news vs. science text). 
Recent advances in deep learning algorithms, large-scale datasets, and industry-scale computational resources are spurring progress in many Natural Language Processing (NLP)tasks.
Nevertheless, current models lack the ability to understand emergent domains such as scientific articles related to Covid-19 when training data are scarce.  
This talk presents some of recent efforts in our lab to address the problem of textual comprehension and reasoning about scientific articles. 
First, I discuss our multi-task learning approach for identifying and classifying entities and their relations in scientific articles. 
I further show that our approach supports construction of a scientific knowledge graph, which we use to analyze information in scientific literature. 
Second, I introduce scientific claim verification, a new task to select abstracts from the research literature containing evidence that supports 
or refutes a given scientific claim, and to identify rationales justifying each decision. 
I finally show that our claim verification system is able to identify plausible evidence for 70% claims relevant to COVID-19 on the CORD-19 corpus.
