# Finding concise descriptors of genomic data 

Genome scale technologies can measure thousands or even millions of molecules but the individual measurements are often noisy
redouts of the internal biological state. For many computational approaches the ultimate goal is to infer the true biological state
parameters from their effects on a much larger set of experimental readouts. Indeed, much of genomic data analysis can be viewed as a
special case of dimensionality reduction.  Unlike a generic dimensionality reduction problem, however, in the biological case we
have extensive prior knowledge about the data-generating process.  In this talk we will discuss several methods that exploit this prior
knowledge to create interpretable  low-dimensional representations for genome scale datasets.
